\chapter{Motivation: Supporting Peer-to-Peer Interactions}

\section{\fancyname{Two Buyer} Protocol}
\begin{itemize}
\item TwoBuyer example
\item Not possible with WebSocket topology
\end{itemize}

\section{Server as a Router}
\begin{itemize}
\item How to make TwoBuyer example work just with WebSockets
\item Essentially `decomposing' multiparty session into binary interactions with respect to the server
\end{itemize}

\section{Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
\item Routed communication is different from `normal' communication
- server cannot overserialise interactions
\item Existing work in decomposing multiparty sessions (see LinearDecompScala paper and the binary one it references) assume the `server' takes on the pure role as a router -- our work argues that the server can still participate in the multiparty session and concurrently route messages between clients in a way that does not overserialise the interactions and allow the routing to be transparent to other roles.
\end{itemize}
