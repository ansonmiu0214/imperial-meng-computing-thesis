\section{Alternative Designs}
\label{section:nodealt}

The main alternative EFSM encoding would be similar to those
presented in \cite{Hybrid2016}, which encodes
each EFSM state in its own class 
and expose communication APIs (e.g. send and/or receive) 
for permitted state transitions.
We would still a session runtime to provide
abstractions over the WebSocket APIs and handle the 
``out-of-order'' arrival of non-causally-related messages.

We conceptualise this alternative design (\cref{fig:nodealt})
using the \tprotocol{One Adder} protocol (\cref{subfig:oneadder}), 
a simplified version of the \tprotocol{Adder} protocol 
but with \textit{curried} addition and without recursion.
An implementation using the alternative API design
(\cref{subfig:oneadderalt}) could have the state transition 
API return a tuple of payload and continuation,
and we could express the event-driven nature of a receive action
using built-in async/await concurrency primitives.
But ultimately, exposing channel resources without a linear type system
means that the developer could violate channel linearity
(i.e. by un-commenting \cref{line:nodebreaklinear}), 
so we would need runtime checks as part of the session runtime.

Looking at alternative designs for the runtime,
we could adopt the approach presented in \cite{TSOP},
which eliminates the need for our \texttt{Implementation} wrapper API
by pushing the workload back to the runtime in the form of a
dense switch statement enumerating all EFSM states.
This may simply the developer API (by removing the need for
the \texttt{Implementation} wrapper), but results in a
session runtime that increases in complexity as the size of the EFSM
increases.
