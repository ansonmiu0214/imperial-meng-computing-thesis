\section{Challenges}
\label{section:nodechallenges}
\begin{itemize}
\item session type implementation on the node runtime
\item need to provide consistency under the single-threaded event loop model
\item provide idiomatic event-driven APIs
\item provide static guarantees where possible -- communication mismatch and channel linearity
\item typescript's type system is gradual, structural and non-linear -- session type api generation examples that provide static guarantees on channel usage build upon target language type system's support for linear resources
\end{itemize}

As outlined in \cref{section:typescript}, TypeScript's type system
is neither affine nor linear, so we need to work around the 
limitations of the language to enforce linear usage of channel resources.
Similarly, we need to 
the language does not provide
built-in constructs for enforcing linear channel usage.
