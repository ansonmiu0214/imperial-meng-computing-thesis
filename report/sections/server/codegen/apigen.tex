\section{Code Generation}

\begin{itemize}
\item api generation is a function of the EFSM representation
\item traditional methods -- visitor pattern on the EFSM and using stringbuilder to build the file
\item templating library is more suitable to decouple the ``presentation'' (how the code should look) from the ``content'' (the EFSM which is used to build the code)
\item strategy pattern to support the two required build targets (in node and react)
\end{itemize}
