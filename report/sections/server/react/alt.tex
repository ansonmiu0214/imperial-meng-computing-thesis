\section{Alternative Designs}
\begin{itemize}
\item not sure whether to put this in the subsection above so it flows better?
\item naive implementation is to pass the send() function as a prop for the developer to incorporate in their event listener -- this is most flexible, but we cannot provide static guarantees
\item factory approach -- the runtime could pass a factory function which, takes an UI element and performs the binding; this is better, as channel resources are not exposed, but the adversarial-minded developer can later override the event listener in the DOM etc
\end{itemize}
