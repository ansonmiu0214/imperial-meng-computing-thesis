The actions by which endpoints are connected and disconnected are a key element of real-world protocols that is not treated in existing MPST works. In addition, the use cases motivating explicit connections often require a more relaxed form of multiparty choice: these extensions do not satisfy the conservative restrictions used to ensure safety in standard syntactic MPST. Instead, we develop a modelling-based approach to validate MPST safety and progress for these enriched protocols. We present a toolchain implementation, for distributed programming based on our extended MPST in Java, and a core formalism, demonstrating the soundness of our approach. We discuss key implementation issues related to the proposed extensions: a practical treatment of choice subtyping for MPST progress, and multiparty correlation of dynamic binary connections.}, booktitle={Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering}, publisher={Springer Berlin Heidelberg}, author={Hu, Raymond and Yoshida, Nobuko}, editor={Huisman, Marieke and Rubin, JuliaEditors}, year={2017}, pages={116–133} }
